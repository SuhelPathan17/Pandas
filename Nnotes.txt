Pandas, which is styled as pandas is an open-source software library designed for the Python programming language, focusing on data manipulation and analysis. 
It provides data structures like series and DataFrames to effectively easily clean, transform, and analyze large datasets and integrates seamlessly with other Python libraries, such as NumPy and Matplotlib.
Pandas revolves around two primary Data structures: Series (1D) for single columns and DataFrame (2D) for tabular data enabling efficient data manipulation.
